### Introduction

Todo-cli is a command line utility to keep track of all the things you need to do throughout your day. The original intention of the program was to be a final project for my computer science class and it still is. However, I have decided to make the project public since I know it might benefit some people. 

### Installation

The program may be installed as follows:

``` shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/aroario2003/todo-cli.git && cd todo-cli && make && sudo make install
```

### Basic Usage
Todo-cli includes a variety of command line arguments. Those are as follows:

|Argument|Function |
|--------|---------| 
| -h     | Get help output|
| -a     | Add an item to a specified to-do list|
| -ad    | Add a due date to a specified to-do item in a list|
| -md    | Mark a to-do item as done represented by a check mark next to the item|
| -mi    | Mark a to-do item as incomplete represented by an x next to the item|
| -r     | Delete a to-do list|
| -c     | Clear all to-do lists of all to-do items|
